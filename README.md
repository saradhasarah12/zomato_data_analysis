# zomato_data_analysis
The Zomato Sales Analysis project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data from Zomato, a prominent food delivery service. Using Power BI and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), this project offers detailed insights into revenue trends, customer behavior patterns, and product performance metrics. The repository includes interactive dashboards and visualizations created with Power BI, enabling stakeholders to visualize and explore key metrics efficiently. By leveraging DAX, custom calculations and data manipulations enhance the depth of analysis, facilitating strategic decision-making for businesses operating in the food service industry. Users can clone the repository to access the Power BI file (Zomato_Sales_Analysis.pbix), where they can explore the provided visualizations and further customize the analysis by connecting to their own Zomato sales datasets.
